with following rules:
Head = F, base = 0.0000
Rule0: A ^ C --> F , A BEFORE F ^ C BEFORE F, weight=0.8000
Rule1: A ^ B ^ C --> F , A BEFORE F ^ B EQUAL F ^ C BEFORE F, weight=0.9000
Rule2: B ^ C ^ D --> F , B EQUAL F ^ C BEFORE F ^ D BEFORE F, weight=0.5000
Rule3: C ^ D --> F , C EQUAL F ^ D BEFORE F, weight=0.6000
Rule4: Not C --> F , Not C BEFORE F, weight=0.7000
