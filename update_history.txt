1. add testing codes in ./unit_test.
use package pytest 6.1.1, docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html
run the following cmd when you are in root directory:
pytest

2. put testing codes in several dirs to avoid repeated testing.

3. if testing codes use argparse, then it raises error when running "pytest file_path".
   since argparse will recognize file_path as its args.

4. in ./model/point_process.py line 66:
    mask = ...(transition_time < t)...
    maybe we can change to  
    mask = ...(transition_time <= t)...
    The boundary condition is meanless, and it may cause bugs.
