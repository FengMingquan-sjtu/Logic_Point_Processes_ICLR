1. add testing codes in ./unit_test.
use package pytest 6.1.1, docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html
run the following cmd when you are in root directory:
pytest

2. put testing codes in several dirs to avoid repeated testing.

3. if testing codes use argparse, then it raises error when running "pytest file_path".
   since argparse will recognize file_path as its args.

4. in ./model/point_process.py line 66:
    mask = ...(transition_time < t)...
    maybe we can change to  
    mask = ...(transition_time <= t)...
    The boundary condition is meanless, and it may cause bugs.

5. notice that self-correcting logic is "A -> Not B", instead of "Not A -> B"

6. In synthetic.py we can divide preds into 3 types:
   1)target pred  2) mapped pred  3)independent pred
   type 2) is copied from 1), and type 3) is random, 
   therefore we only need to synthetic (using thining) 1) type.

   Notice that the generation order is  3) --> 1) --> 2). 
   At time t, we first randomly generate an event t_3 of 3),
   then, synthetic events of 1) in interval [t, t_3].

   Also, 1) can be further divided into 1.1)instant and 1.2)continuous. 

7. how to decide the max intensity point in a short interval? only need to calculate sign of f*w.

8. using seed, we can test correctness of synthetic data.
